# web-crawler
This is my simple web crawler, for exploring the internet...

The project was hardly inspired by https://www.youtube.com/user/CreatiiveCode. But not completly copied...

I recomend running it on a local server like xammp in the console, because when running in the browser, it gets timeout error for taking too long to load. 
The database structure:

id(AI)  title(title of the page)  description(description of the page)  keywords(common words found my the script)  url(absolute address to the page) url_hash(hashed url)
